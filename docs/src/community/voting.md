# Lance Community Voting Process

Lance uses a consensus-based voting process for decision-making.

## Expressing Votes

Votes are expressed as the following:

- **+1**: Yes
- **0**: Abstain
- **-1**: No

When voting, it is recommended that voters indicate whether their vote is binding or not (e.g., `+1 (non-binding)`, `-1 (binding)`)
to ease the counting of binding votes.

In addition to the vote, voters can also express their justification as part of the comment.
**-1** votes must include justification to allow meaningful discussion.
Any **-1** vote not accompanied by justification is considered invalid.

For votes conducted on GitHub Discussions,
each vote should be cast as an independent comment instead of as a reply within a comment.
This ensures that people can discuss the vote as replies to that specific comment if needed
(e.g., to discuss **-1** vetoes or address concerns).

## Binding Votes

Only votes from the binding voters are counted for each decision,
but other people in the community are also encouraged to cast non-binding votes.
Binding voters should consider any concern from non-binding voters during the vote process.

## Vetoes

A **-1** binding vote is considered a veto for all decision types. Vetoes:

- Stop the proposal until the concerns are resolved
- Cannot be overruled
- Trigger consensus gathering to address concerns
