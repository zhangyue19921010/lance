# Maintainers

A maintainer is a contributor who has made sustained and valuable contributions to the Lance community.
Maintainers are recognized for their work and granted various rights to support their ongoing contributions.

## Rights

All maintainers have the following rights:

- GitHub triage permissions on all Lance repositories
- Publish preview/beta releases of all Lance projects at any time
- Propose stable releases of all Lance projects
- Execute stable releases after the vote has passed

Some maintainers may be granted GitHub write access to Lance repositories, which allows them to review and merge pull requests.
Maintainers with write access may refer to themselves as "committers" when communicating outside the project,
as this is a widely recognized term in the open source ecosystem,
though "committer" is not part of the official Lance governance structure.

Maintainers with GitHub write access additionally have the following rights:

- GitHub write access to all Lance repositories
- Approve and merge code modifications in all Lance projects (except changes to format specifications)

## Activities

Maintainers are encouraged to:

- Continue making valuable contributions to the Lance projects
- Help review PRs and provide feedback when possible
- Volunteer as release manager for stable releases when proposed
- Participate in community discussions and support other users
- Mentor and grow new maintainers
