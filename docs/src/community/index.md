# Lance Community Governance

The Lance community is run by volunteers in a collaborative and open way.
Its governance is inspired by open source foundations and projects such as ASF, CNCF, and Substrait.

## Governance Structure

The Lance community recognizes three tiers of participation:

### Contributors

Everyone who has made a contribution to Lance is a contributor.

A "contribution" is not limited to code changes.
Adopting Lance in personal or company projects, providing bug reports and feature requests, performing code reviews,
organizing or planning community gatherings, giving talks, creating and assisting in branding and design,
writing documentation, and many other activities are all counted as contributions.

All contributions, regardless of form, are valued and greatly appreciated.
It is entirely possible to advance through the governance tiers without writing code.

### Maintainers

A maintainer is a contributor who has made sustained and valuable contributions to the Lance community.
Maintainers are recognized for their work and granted various rights to support their ongoing contributions.
For more details of the activities, rights, roster and how to become a maintainer, see [Maintainers](./maintainers.md).

### Project Management Committee (PMC)

A PMC member is a maintainer who has demonstrated leadership in the project.
The PMC guides the long-term direction, makes decisions on governance and project changes, and protects the Lance brand.
For more details of the activities, rights, roster and how to become a PMC member, see [PMC](./pmc.md).

### Roster Information

Maintainer and PMC rosters information follow these guidelines:

- **Ordering**: People in the roster are listed in alphabetical order by last name
- **Self-Report**: Personal information such as _Affiliation_ and _Ecosystem Roles_ is self-reported and updated at the individual's discretion.
- **Ecosystem Roles**: This field documents the individual's involvement in other open source projects if any. It helps identify potential collaboration and integration pathways with the broader open source ecosystem.

## Projects

This section details the projects maintained in the Lance community.

### Core Projects

Core projects are the foundational repositories maintained by the Lance community with strict quality and release standards.
[Contributing Guidelines](./contributing.md), [Community Voting Process](./voting.md) and [Release Guidelines](./release.md) 
are all applicable to these projects.

Here is the list of current core projects:

| Project Name      | Repository                                     | Contents                                                                                                                 |

### Subprojects

Subprojects are initiatives or repositories that extend Lance's functionality.
They must align with Lance's overall mission and technical direction.
New subprojects can be created with PMC approval.

Subprojects have relaxed requirements for contribution,
where contributors may receive write access even if not maintainers.

Here is the list of current subprojects:

| Project Name      | Repository                                     | Contents                                            |

### Graduating a Subproject

The PMC can vote to promote a subproject to a core project once the subproject has demonstrated aspects including:

- Proper repository setup including CI, issue tracking, contributing guide, etc.
- Proper code standard enforcement including lint, testing, etc.
- Automated release mechanism
- Established production use cases
- Community adoption outside the primary contributor
- Consistent contributions from the community to add new features and fix bugs

### External Integrations

We welcome and encourage Lance integrations in external projects.
These integrations are valuable contributions to the Lance community and help expand the Lance ecosystem.
When integrations are developed in external projects,
the integration code and licensing should follow the guidelines and license of the external project.

## Reporting Security Vulnerability

In case of any security vulnerability,
please contact the PMC through the [Lance Private Mailing List](mailto:private@lance.org)
and refrain from public disclosure until the issue is resolved.
