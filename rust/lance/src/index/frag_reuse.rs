/// 2. the destination deletion vectors must hold exactly the summed delta
///    rows -- no extras, no misses;
/// 3. per destination, the translated delta positions must equal the
///    supplied deletion vector as a SET -- a count match with a position
///    mismatch is one row wrongly dead plus one row resurrected.
///
/// AUTHORITY: source deletion state is read from the CURRENT MANIFEST
/// fragments, never from the job-supplied rewrite group, which establishes
/// group identity and ordering only. Trusting the group here would let a
/// crafted group deletion vector resurrect one row while wrongly deleting
/// another with all counts matching.
///
/// The translation is the reader stack's own [`MappingReader`]
/// (`OrderedCompactionMapping` over the transition's survivor bitmap, or
/// `StablePartitionMapping` over the row map file, opened exactly as the
/// reader opens it). Deleted offsets are translated in bounded batches, and
/// the expected destination positions accumulate as one `RoaringBitmap` per
/// destination, so memory stays bounded by the batch size plus the bitmaps.
