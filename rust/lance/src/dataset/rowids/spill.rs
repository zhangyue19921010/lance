//! Spilling a fragment's row lineage sequences -- its row ids and its
//! created-at and last-updated-at versions -- out of the manifest and into
//! hidden columns of a Lance data file.
//!
//! A row id sequence is run-encoded, so an appended fragment costs about 20
//! bytes of manifest and never needs to leave it. A fragment whose rows came
//! from many places -- the output of compacting a shuffled table, for instance
//! -- has no runs to exploit and falls back to 8 bytes per row. The version
//! sequences are run-length encoded and degrade the same way once a fragment
//! interleaves rows written at many versions. Inline, that cost is paid again
//! in every manifest version, so the manifest grows with the table and every
//! commit rewrites all of it.
//!
//! Spilled, each sequence is an ordinary `UInt64` column carrying one of the
//! reserved field ids [`ROW_ID_FIELD_ID`], [`ROW_CREATED_AT_VERSION_FIELD_ID`]
//! or [`ROW_LAST_UPDATED_AT_VERSION_FIELD_ID`], written with the same encodings
//! and read with the same reader as user data. The file is one of the
//! fragment's own data files, found by that field id; the fragment's metadata
//! only marks the sequence as spilled. A fragment's spilled sequences written
//! here share one such file.
